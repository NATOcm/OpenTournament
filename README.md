# OpenTournament

The Open Tournament project is a community-led effort to develop a game that will recreate and expand upon the formula of Unreal Tournament, Quake, and other classic FPS gameplay.

* We are working towards a public build release with a more representative sample of features and content
* We are also working on both an internal and external roadmap that we would feel more comfortable discussing!
* This is a private repository with access available on request, for contributors. Code is (c) 2019 Open Tournament Team
* Please do not share code or content outside of our private Discord channels without discussing with other project members!
